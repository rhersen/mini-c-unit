double sine(double x, double limit)

zero = x - x

x ≠ zero ? run
return zero

run:
one = x ÷ x
two = one + one
minus = one - two

sign = minus
i = one
factorial = one
term = x
quotient = term
sum = zero

loop:
sign ×= minus
quotient ×= sign
sum += quotient
i += one
factorial ×= i
term ×= x
i += one
factorial ×= i
term ×= x
quotient = term ÷ factorial
quotient > limit ? loop

sign ×= minus
quotient ×= sign
sum += quotient
return sum
