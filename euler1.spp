double euler1(double limit, double three, double five)

one = three ÷ three
zero = one - one

sum = zero

loop:
quotient = i ÷ three

isDivisibleByThree = quotient ≡ rounded
quotient = i ÷ five
rounded = roundsd(quotient, 3)
isDivisibleByFive = quotient ≡ rounded
isDivisible = isDivisibleByFive ∨ isDivisibleByThree
term = isDivisible ∧ i
sum += term
